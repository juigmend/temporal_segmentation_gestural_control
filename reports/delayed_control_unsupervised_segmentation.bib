@inproceedings{Tardieu_etal_2009,
	abstract = {An interactive loop between motion recognition and motion generation is a fundamental mechanism for humans and humanoid robots. We have been developing an intelligent framework for motion recognition and generation based on symbolizing motion primitives. The motion primitives are encoded into Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which we call ``motion symbols''. However, to determine the motion primitives to use as training data for the HMMs, this framework requires a manual segmentation of human motions. Essentially, a humanoid robot is expected to participate in daily life and must learn many motion symbols to adapt to various situations. For this use, manual segmentation is cumbersome and impractical for humanoid robots. In this study, we propose a novel approach to segmentation, the Real-time Unsupervised Segmentation (RUS) method, which comprises three phases. In the first phase, short human movements are encoded into feature HMMs. Seamless human motion can be converted to a sequence of these feature HMMs. In the second phase, the causality between the feature HMMs is extracted. The causality data make it possible to predict movement from observation. In the third phase, movements having a large prediction uncertainty are designated as the boundaries of motion primitives. In this way, human whole-body motion can be segmented into a sequence of motion primitives. This paper also describes an application of RUS to AUtonomous Symbolization of motion primitives (AUS). Each derived motion primitive is classified into an HMM for a motion symbol, and parameters of the HMMs are optimized by using the motion primitives as training data in competitive learning. The HMMs are gradually optimized in such a way that the HMMs can abstract similar motion primitives. We tested the RUS and AUS frameworks on captured human whole-body motions and demonstrated the validity of the proposed framework.},

@article{Cornacchia_et_al_2017,
	abstract = {Activity detection and classification are very important for autonomous monitoring of humans for applications, including assistive living, rehabilitation, and surveillance. Wearable sensors have found wide-spread use in recent years due to their ever-decreasing cost, ease of deployment and use, and ability to provide continuous monitoring as opposed to sensors installed at fixed locations. Since many smart phones are now equipped with a variety of sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera, it has become more feasible to develop activity monitoring algorithms employing one or more of these sensors with increased accessibility. We provide a complete and comprehensive survey on activity classification with wearable sensors, covering a variety of sensing modalities, including accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure sensors, and camera- and depth-based systems. We discuss differences in activity types tackled by this breadth of sensing modalities. For example, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer systems have a history of addressing whole body motion or global type activities, whereas camera systems provide the context necessary to classify local interactions, or interactions of individuals with objects. We also found that these single sensing modalities laid the foundation for hybrid works that tackle a mix of global and local interaction-type activities. In addition to the type of sensors and type of activities classified, we provide details on each wearable system that include on-body sensor location, employed learning approach, and extent of experimental setup. We further discuss where the processing is performed, i.e., local versus remote processing, for different systems. This is one of the first surveys to provide such breadth of coverage across different wearable sensor systems for activity classification.},

	abstract = {There has been a keen interest in detecting abrupt sequential changes in streaming data obtained from sensors in wireless sensor networks for Internet of Things applications, such as fire/fault detection, activity recognition, and environmental monitoring. Such applications require (near) online detection of instantaneous changes. This paper proposes an online, adaptive filtering-based change detection (OFCD) algorithm. Our method is based on a convex combination of two decoupled least mean square windowed filters with differing sizes. Both filters are applied independently on data streams obtained from sensor nodes such that their convex combination parameter is employed as an indicator of abrupt changes in mean values. An extension of our method (OFCD) based on a cooperative scheme between multiple sensors (COFCD) is also presented. It provides an enhancement of both convergence and steady-state accuracy of the convex weight parameter. Our conducted experiments show that our approach can be applied in distributed networks in an online fashion. It also provides better performance and less complexity compared with the state-of-the-art on both of single and multiple sensors.},

Within this paper, we extend our previous work on the Multivariate Online Change detection Algorithm subsequently exploring the utility of incorporating the Benjamini Hochberg method of correcting for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach against similarly light-weight Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and Cumulative Sum based techniques. Results are presented based on manually labelled change points in accelerometry data captured using 10 participants. Each participant performed nine distinct activities for a total period of 35 minutes. The results subsequently demonstrate the practical potential of our approach from both accuracy and computational perspectives.},

Detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring, climate change detection, speech and image analysis, and human activity analysis. This survey article enumerates, categorizes, and compares many of the methods that have been proposed to detect change points in time series. The methods examined include both supervised and unsupervised algorithms that have been introduced and evaluated. We introduce several criteria to compare the algorithms.

@article{Zameni_et_al_2020,
	abstract = {A critical problem in time series analysis is change point detection, which identifies the times when the underlying distribution of a time series abruptly changes. However, several shortcomings limit the use of some existing techniques in real-world applications. First, several change point detection techniques are offline methods, where the whole time series needs to be stored before change point detection can be performed. These methods are not applicable to streaming time series. Second, most techniques assume that the time series is low-dimensional and hence have problems handling high-dimensional time series, where not all dimensions may cause the change. Finally, most methods require user-defined parameters that need to be chosen based on the observed data, which limits their applicability to new unseen data. To address these issues, we propose an Information Gain-based method that does not require prior distributional knowledge for detecting change points and handles high-dimensional time series. The advantages of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms are demonstrated from theoretical basis, as well as via experiments on four synthetic and three real-world human activity datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses recognition of human actions under view changes. We explore self-similarities of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation, we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this temporal self-similarity descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating its high stability under view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown to be stable under performance variations within a class of actions when individual speed fluctuations are ignored. If required, such fluctuations between two different instances of the same action class can be explicitly recovered with dynamic time warping, as will be demonstrated, to achieve cross-view action synchronization. More central to the current work, temporal ordering of local self-similarity descriptors can simply be ignored within a bag-of-features type of approach. Sufficient action discrimination is still retained in this way to build a view-independent action recognition system. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multiview correspondence estimation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public data sets. It has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions, such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views only for training.},

	abstract = {Temporal segmentation of human motion into plausible motion primitives is central to understanding and building computational models of human motion. Several issues contribute to the challenge of discovering motion primitives: the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations, the variability in the temporal scale of human actions, and the complexity of representing articulated motion. We pose the problem of learning motion primitives as one of temporal clustering, and derive an unsupervised hierarchical bottom-up framework called hierarchical aligned cluster analysis (HACA). HACA finds a partition of a given multidimensional time series into m disjoint segments such that each segment belongs to one of k clusters. HACA combines kernel k-means with the generalized dynamic time alignment kernel to cluster time series data. Moreover, it provides a natural framework to find a low-dimensional embedding for time series. HACA is efficiently optimized with a coordinate descent strategy and dynamic programming. Experimental results on motion capture and video data demonstrate the effectiveness of HACA for segmenting complex motions and as a visualization tool. We also compare the performance of HACA to state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal clustering on data of a honey bee dance. The HACA code is available online.},

@article{Gharghabi_et_al_2019,
	abstract = {Unsupervised semantic segmentation in the time series domain is a much studied problem due to its potential to detect unexpected regularities and regimes in poorly understood data. However, the current techniques have several shortcomings, which have limited the adoption of time series semantic segmentation beyond academic settings for four primary reasons. First, most methods require setting/learning many parameters and thus may have problems generalizing to novel situations. Second, most methods implicitly assume that all the data is segmentable and have difficulty when that assumption is unwarranted. Thirdly, many algorithms are only defined for the single dimensional case, despite the ubiquity of multi-dimensional data. Finally, most research efforts have been confined to the batch case, but online segmentation is clearly more useful and actionable. To address these issues, we present a multi-dimensional algorithm, which is domain agnostic, has only one, easily-determined parameter, and can handle data streaming at a high rate. In this context, we test the algorithm on the largest and most diverse collection of time series datasets ever considered for this task and demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over current solutions.},

	abstract = {Studies on human motion have attracted a lot of attentions. Human motion capture data, which much more precisely records human motion than videos do, has been widely used in many areas. Motion segmentation is an indispensable step for many related applications, but current segmentation methods for motion capture data do not effectively model some important characteristics of motion capture data, such as Riemannian manifold structure and containing non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we convert the segmentation of motion capture data into a temporal subspace clustering problem. Under the framework of sparse subspace clustering, we propose to use the geodesic exponential kernel to model the Riemannian manifold structure, use correntropy to measure the reconstruction error, use the triangle constraint to guarantee temporal continuity in each cluster and use multi-view reconstruction to extract the relations between different joints. Therefore, exploiting some special characteristics of motion capture data, we propose a new segmentation method, which is robust to non-Gaussian noise, since correntropy is a localized similarity measure. We also develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on block coordinate descent method to solve the proposed model. Our optimization algorithm has a linear complexity while sparse subspace clustering is originally a quadratic problem. Extensive experiment results both on simulated noisy data set and real noisy data set demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of structure learning of human motion in order to recognize actions from a continuous monocular motion sequence of an arbitrary person from an arbitrary viewpoint. Human motion sequences are represented by multivariate time series in the joint-trajectories space. Under this structured time series framework, we first propose Kernelized Temporal Cut (KTC), an extension of previous works on change-point detection by incorporating Hilbert space embedding of distributions, to handle the nonparametric and high dimensionality issues of human motions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields realtime segmentation, and produces high action segmentation accuracy. Second, a spatio-temporal manifold framework is proposed to model the latent structure of time series data. Then an efficient spatio-temporal alignment algorithm Dynamic Manifold Warping (DMW) is proposed for multivariate time series to calculate motion similarity between action sequences (segments). Furthermore, by combining the temporal segmentation algorithm and the alignment algorithm, online human action recognition can be performed by associating a few labeled examples from motion capture data. The results on human motion capture data and 3D depth sensor data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically segmenting and recognizing motion sequences, and its ability to handle noisy and partially occluded data, in the transfer learning module.},

@article{Bargi_Da_Xu_Piccardi_2018,
	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing need for the automated classification of sequential data, such as activities of daily living, social media interactions, financial series, and others. With the continuous flow of new data, it is critical to classify the observations on-the-fly and without being limited by a predetermined number of classes. In addition, a model should be able to update its parameters in response to a possible evolution in the distributions of the classes. This compelling problem, however, does not seem to have been adequately addressed in the literature, since most studies focus on offline classification over predefined class sets. In this paper, we present a principled solution for this problem based on an adaptive online system leveraging Markov switching models and hierarchical Dirichlet process priors. This adaptive online approach is capable of classifying the sequential data over an unlimited number of classes while meeting the memory and delay constraints typical of streaming contexts. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive {\^a}€{\oe}learning rate{\^a}€that is responsible for balancing the extent to which the model retains its previous parameters or adapts to new observations. Experimental results on stationary and evolving synthetic data and two video data sets, TUM Assistive Kitchen and collated Weizmann, show a remarkable performance in terms of segmentation and classification, particularly for sequences from evolutionary distributions and/or those containing previously unseen classes.},

@article{Taniguchi_Hamahata_Iwahashi_2011,
	abstract = { We propose an unsupervised motion segmentation method for enabling a robot to imitate and perform various unit motions by observing unsegmented human motion. Natural unsegmented human motion data contain various types of unit motions, such as 'waving good-bye', 'walking' and 'throwing a ball'. A robot has to segment the data and extract unit motions from the data to imitate the motions. In previous work, an ergodic hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to model unsegmented human motion. However, there are two main problems with the classical use of this model. (i) Setting an appropriate number of hidden states is difficult because how complex the motions contained in the learning data are and how many there are unknown. (ii) We did not have an effective chunking method that could chunk elemental motions into meaningful unit motions without being captured by local minima. To overcome these problems, we developed an unsupervised motion segmentation method for imitation learning using a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)-HMM, a nonparametric Bayesian model, and an unsupervised chunking method based on a Gibbs sampler and the minimal description length (MDL) principle of imitation learning of unsegmented human motion. We developed this chunking method to work with the sticky HDP-HMM and extract unit human motions. We conducted several experiments to evaluate this method. The proposed method could extract unit motions from unsegmented human motion data. The sticky HDP-HMM can be used to model unsegmented human motion more accurately than with a conventional HMM and simultaneously estimate the number of hidden states. We also evaluated the dependency of the HDP-HMM on the hyperparameters of the model. },

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach for incremental learning of human motion pattern primitives through online observation of human motion. The observed time series data stream is first stochastically segmented into potential motion primitive segments, based on the assumption that data belonging to the same motion primitive will have the same underlying distribution. The motion segments are then abstracted into a stochastic model representation and automatically clustered and organized. As new motion patterns are observed, they are incrementally grouped together into a tree structure, based on their relative distance in the model space. The tree leaves, which represent the most specialized learned motion primitives, are then passed back to the segmentation algorithm so that as the number of known motion primitives increases, the accuracy of the segmentation can also be improved. The combined algorithm is tested on a sequence of continuous human motion data that are obtained through motion capture, and demonstrates the performance of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Our goal is to automatically segment and recognize basic human actions, such as stand, walk and wave hands, from a sequence of joint positions or pose angles. Such recognition is difficult due to high dimensionality of the data and large spatial and temporal variations in the same action. We decompose the high dimensional 3-D joint space into a set of feature spaces where each feature corresponds to the motion of a single joint or combination of related multiple joints. For each feature, the dynamics of each action class is learned with one HMM. Given a sequence, the observation probability is computed in each HMM and a weak classifier for that feature is formed based on those probabilities. The weak classifiers with strong discriminative power are then combined by the Multi-Class AdaBoost (AdaBoost.M2) algorithm. A dynamic programming algorithm is applied to segment and recognize actions simultaneously. Results of recognizing 22 actions on a large number of motion capture sequences as well as several annotated and automatically tracked sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Activity recognition is the process of inferring an action class from a set of observations acquired by sensors. We address the temporal segmentation problem of body part trajectories in Cartesian Space in which features are generated using Discrete Fast Fourier Transform (DFFT) and Power Spectrum (PS). We pose this as an entropy minimization problem. Using entropy from the classifier output as a feedback parameter, we continuously adjust the two key parameters in a sliding window approach, to maximize the model confidence at every step. The proposed classifier is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model where classes are estimated using Bayesian inference. We compare our approach with our previously developed fixed window method. Experiments show that our method accurately recognizes and segments activities, with improved model confidence and faster convergence times, exhibiting anticipatory capabilities. Our work demonstrates that entropy feedback mitigates variability problems, and our method is applicable in research areas where action segmentation and classification is used.

The automatically segmented and recognized action instances are subsequently fed to the framework action evaluation component, which compares them with the corresponding reference ones, estimating their similarity. Exploiting fuzzy logic, the framework subsequently gives semantic feedback with instructions on performing the actions more accurately. Experimental results on MSR-Action3D and MSRC12 benchmarking datasets and a new, publicly available one, provide evidence that the proposed framework compares favourably to state-of-the-art methods by 0.5--6% in all three datasets, showing that the proposed method can be effectively used for unsupervised gesture/action training.},

To this end, we reformulate the original Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) formulation as a linear dynamical system with control inputs. Based on this new formulation, we develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the duration and goal position of a partially observed trajectory.

We use neighborhood graphs for the partitioning and the similarity information in the graph is further exploited to cluster the motion primitives into larger entities of semantic significance. The method requires no assumptions about the motion sequences at hand and no user interaction is required for the segmentation or clustering. In addition, we introduce a feature bundling preprocessing technique to make the segmentation more robust to noise, as well as a notion of motion symmetry for more refined primitive detection. We test our method on several sensor modalities, including markered and markerless motion capture as well as on electromyograph and accelerometer recordings. The results highlight our system's capabilities for both segmentation and for analysis of the finer structures of motion data, all in a completely unsupervised manner.},

In this paper, we introduce a framework that puts motion segmentation algorithms on a unified testing ground and provides a possibility to allow comparing them. The testing ground features both a set of quality measures known from the literature and a novel approach tailored to the evaluation of motion segmentation algorithms, termed Integrated Kernel approach. Datasets of motion recordings, provided with a ground truth, are included as well.

	abstract = {The characterization and abstraction of large multivariate time series data often poses challenges with respect to effectiveness or efficiency. Using the example of human motion capture data challenges exist in creating compact solutions that still reflect semantics and kinematics in a meaningful way. We present a visual-interactive approach for the semi-supervised labeling of human motion capture data. Users are enabled to assign labels to the data which can subsequently be used to represent the multivariate time series as sequences of motion classes. The approach combines multiple views supporting the user in the visual-interactive labeling process. Visual guidance concepts further ease the labeling process by propagating the results of supportive algorithmic models. The abstraction of motion capture data to sequences of event intervals allows overview and detail-on-demand visualizations even for large and heterogeneous data collections. The guided selection of candidate data for the extension and improvement of the labeling closes the feedback loop of the semi-supervised workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the approach in two usage scenarios, taking visual-interactive learning and human motion synthesis as examples.},

	abstract = {An interactive loop between motion recognition and motion generation is a fundamental mechanism for humans and humanoid robots. We have been developing an intelligent framework for motion recognition and generation based on symbolizing motion primitives. The motion primitives are encoded into Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which we call ``motion symbols''. However, to determine the motion primitives to use as training data for the HMMs, this framework requires a manual segmentation of human motions. Essentially, a humanoid robot is expected to participate in daily life and must learn many motion symbols to adapt to various situations. For this use, manual segmentation is cumbersome and impractical for humanoid robots. In this study, we propose a novel approach to segmentation, the Real-time Unsupervised Segmentation (RUS) method, which comprises three phases. In the first phase, short human movements are encoded into feature HMMs. Seamless human motion can be converted to a sequence of these feature HMMs. In the second phase, the causality between the feature HMMs is extracted. The causality data make it possible to predict movement from observation. In the third phase, movements having a large prediction uncertainty are designated as the boundaries of motion primitives. In this way, human whole-body motion can be segmented into a sequence of motion primitives. This paper also describes an application of RUS to AUtonomous Symbolization of motion primitives (AUS). Each derived motion primitive is classified into an HMM for a motion symbol, and parameters of the HMMs are optimized by using the motion primitives as training data in competitive learning. The HMMs are gradually optimized in such a way that the HMMs can abstract similar motion primitives. We tested the RUS and AUS frameworks on captured human whole-body motions and demonstrated the validity of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for motion segmentation by using strategies of splitting and remerging. The presented approach, Mossar, hybridizes two existing ones to obtain their potential advantages while covering weaknesses: (1) velocity-based, one of the most widely used approaches that has fairly low accuracy but provides computational simplicity and (2) graph-based, a state-of-the-art approach that provides outstanding accuracy, yet bears high computational complexity and a burden in setting of thresholds. An initial set of key frames is generated by a velocity-based splitting process and then fed into a graph-based remerging process for refinement. We present mechanisms that improve key-frames capturing in the velocity-based approach as well as details on how the graph-based approach is modified and later applied to remerging. The proposed approach also allows users to interactively add or reduce the number of key frames to control segmentation hierarchy without the need to change threshold values and re-run segmentation, as usually done in existing approaches. Our experimental results show that the presented hybrid approach, compared to both velocity-based and graph-based, demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and in comparison to graph-based, our approach has not only less complexity but also a lesser number of thresholds, the values of which can be much more simply determined.},

	abstract = {Motion capture of the human body has being performed for decades with a growing number of technologies, aims and application fields; but only recent optical markerless technologies based on silhouette recognition and depth sensors which have been developed for videogames control interface have brought motion capture to a broad diffusion. Actually, nowadays there are low cost hardware and software suitable for a wide range of applications that may vary from entertainment domain (e.g., videogames, virtual characters in movies) to the biomechanical and biomedical domain (e.g., gait analysis or orthopedic rehabilitation) and to a huge number of industrial sectors. In this quick evolving scenario it is hard to tell which technology is the most suitable for any desired goal. The aim of the paper is to answer to this issue by presenting a benchmark analysis that compares RGB and RGB-D technologies used to track performing people in a variety of conditions. In order to contrast the solutions, several different tasks have been selected, simultaneously captured and post-processed exactly in the same way. The test campaign has been designed to evaluate pros and cons according to the most important feature of a motion capture technology, such as volume of acquisition, accuracy of joint position and tracking of fast movements. Actors were asked to perform a number of tasks, among which free movements of arms, legs and full body, gait, and tasks performed interacting with a machine. The number of sensors around the scene and their disposition have been considered as well. We used Sony PS Eye cameras and Microsoft Kinect sensors as hardware solutions and iPisoft for data elaboration. The gathered results are organized, compared and discussed stressing performances and limitations of any combination and, at last, we proposed the best candidate technology for some key applications.},

	abstract = { AbstractObjective: Sport research often requires human motion capture of an athlete. It can, however, be labour-intensive and difficult to select the right system, while manufacturers report on specifications which are determined in set-ups that largely differ from sport research in terms of volume, environment and motion. The aim of this review is to assist researchers in the selection of a suitable motion capture system for their experimental set-up for sport applications. An open online platform is initiated, to support (sport)researchers in the selection of a system and to enable them to contribute and update the overview. Design: systematic review; Method: Electronic searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were performed, and the reference lists of the screened articles were scrutinised to determine human motion capture systems used in academically published studies on sport analysis. Results: An overview of 17 human motion capture systems is provided, reporting the general specifications given by the manufacturer (weight and size of the sensors, maximum capture volume, environmental feasibilities), and calibration specifications as determined in peer-reviewed studies. The accuracy of each system is plotted against the measurement range. Conclusion: The overview and chart can assist researchers in the selection of a suitable measurement system. To increase the robustness of the database and to keep up with technological developments, we encourage researchers to perform an accuracy test prior to their experiment and to add to the chart and the system overview (online, open access). },
